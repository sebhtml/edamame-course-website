	<h3>Course Overview and Information</h3>
	<p>The course starts at 9:15am on Wednesday, Aug 13th, and ends at noon on Wednesday, Aug 20th.  We will have an afternoon off on Sunday.  Please plan to arrive on Tuesday, August 12th, so that you are ready to go on Wednesday morning.  Please plan to leave...</p>
	<p>The course classroom will be the Terrace Room, which is close to the apartments where we will be staying.  Feel free to wander by; we'll probably be doing some setup on Tuesday.</p>
	<p>The weather is usually pretty nice, between 60 and 90 deg Faranheit (15 and 25 degrees Celsius?)  Think sandals and shorts weather mostly, with some cold days necessitating pants.  Dress is casual.</p>
	<p>There will be opportunities for sports and entertainment, including but not limited to: swimming; volleyball; ultimate frisbee; soccer; and running.</p>
	<p>Towels and bedding are provided.</p>
	<p>We will be reasonably close to stores that can provide pretty much anything you need, and we will have transportation to/from them.</p>
