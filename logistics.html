      <h3></h3>Public course Web site:</h3>
      <p>http://edamame-course.org</p>
      <p>Email: edamame.course@gmail.com</p>
      <h3>Course Overview and Information</h3>
      <p>The course starts at 9:15am on Wednesday, Aug 13th, and ends at noon on Wednesday, Aug 20th.  We will have an afternoon off on Sunday.  Generally, we will have lectures and tutorials from 9:30-12pm, break for lunch, reconvene from 1-4pm, have late afternoons free until after dinner, and then have an evening lecture from 8-10pm.

<p>The course classroom will be the Terrace Room, which is close to the Apartments where we will be staying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The weather is usually pretty nice, between 60 and 90 deg F.  Think sandals and shorts weather mostly, with some cold days necessitating pants.  Dress is casual. There will be opportunities for sports and entertainment, including but not limited to: swimming; volleyball; ultimate frisbee; soccer; and running. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We will be reasonably close to stores that can provide pretty much anything you need, and we will have transportation to/from them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The course fee is $600.</b>This fee includes room and board ($350 - see specifics below), and a workshop fee ($250) that will be used for course expenses, such as facilities rental, guest instructor room and board, and snacks. The workshop fee will be charged when you register for room and board at KBS.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Registration Deadline.</b> Please plan to make arrangements to register (by reserving your housing and paying workshop fees) by July 1st.  If we haven’t heard from you by then we will assume that you are no longer interested in the course, and will invite someone from our wait list as a replacement.</p>
<!--
<h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
<p>No swimming alone.  Ever.</p>
<p></p>
-->
<h3>Room and Board</h3>
<h4>Housing</h4>
<p>We will be staying in the <a href="http://www.kbs.msu.edu/visit/conference-center/facilities">Apartments</a>, which sleep two per apartment. Each Apartment has a kitchenette and refrigerator. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Please complete a <a href= "http://www.kbs.msu.edu/images/stories/docs/Conference_Center/Housing_Reservation_Form_2012_revised.pdf">Housing Reservation Form</a> and communicate it back to KBS (email: conference@kbs.msu.edu).  KBS will give you an exact cost for room & board based on the housing form and our agreement with them.  When you make a housing reservation, a $50 deposit is required.  Full Room and Board payment is due at check-in.  Credit cards can be used for payment.</p>
<p>Room and board fees are below.  Note that these fees do not include MI sales tax of 6%, which will be charged on the total invoice.  Everyone staying on campus must have a meal plan.  Towels and bedding are provided.</p>
<p>- $300/week - double occupancy room and board, plus tax</p>
<p>- $326/week - single occupancy room and board, plus tax</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Meals included</h4>
<p>- Lunch - Monday to Sunday</p>
<p>- Dinner - Monday to Thursday</p>
<p>- Continental Breakfast is optional for an extra $6.00 per person (served Monday to Friday)</p>
<p></p>
<p>KBS is extremely accommodating to dietary issues, so just be sure to inform me of anything rare that they would need to prepare for. (gluten allergies, for example).</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Child care</h4>For those of you bringing family, please let us know.  Also, please let us know if childcare or a nursing room is something that you need ASAP.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Travel</h3> 
<h4>Arrival</h4>
<p>Please plan to arrive on Tuesday, August 12th, so that you are ready to go on Wednesday morning. </p>
<p>If you are flying into the area, we strongly recommend one of the following travel options:</p>
<p>- arriving into Detroit Airport (DTW) on Tuesday and taking the <a href= "michiganflyer.com">Michigan Flyer</a> to downtown East Lansing.</p>
<p>- arriving into Lansing Airport (LAN) on Tuesday.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you're taking the Flyer into East Lansing, it arrives at the downtown Marriott -- that's the only stop.  Downtown East Lansing surrounds the hotel and the Marriott will probably be fine with letting you park your luggage there while you go grab some food or coffee or just take a walk.</p>
<p>We will be providing transportation from LAN to the course, as well as from other area locations as needed.</p>
<p>You will not need a car or any other form of transportation, but you are welcome to bring one -- there's plenty of parking.  There are supermarkets nearby and you'll be able to get there and back with transportation provided by the course.</p>
<h4>Departure</h4>Please plan to leave KBS campus by Thursday Aug 21 in the morning. We encourage you to try to leave on Wednesday afternoon/evening if possible.  This would save you the cost of an extra day of lodging/room and board. We’ll be leaving the Kalamazoo area on Aug 20 by around 2 pm, and we can safely get you to the Lansing airport or the Michigan Flyer by 3:30 pm, or the Flint airport by 5 pm, or the Detroit airport by 6pm.
<p></p>
<h3>Computer requirements</h3> You will need a computer.  It must be capable of running a Web browser, installing a small set of software and otherwise functioning.  There are no operating system or "compute power" requirements, as we'll be renting virtual machines from Amazon for the purpose of doing the actual computation. Please install the following software on your computer in advance.  We are available to help if you have difficulties, please email.  It is important that everyone has QIIME up and running for our first day! 
<p></p>
<h4>1.  QIIME</h4>
<p>We recommend the following QIIME installation options:</p>
<p>If you have a Mac, install <a href="http://www.wernerlab.org/software/macqiime">MacQIIME. </a></p>
<p>If you have a PC, please install <a href="http://qiime.org/install/virtual_box.html">QIIME’s virtual box.</a></p>
<p><i>Note:  We strongly advise against a full, manual install of QIIME.</i></p>
<p></p>
<h4>2.  R and R studio</h4>
<p>First, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">download R.</a></p>
<p>Next, install <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">R studio.</a></p>


<h4>3.  Web browser compatability</h4>
<p>Finally, please make sure that your Web browser can connect to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon Web services</a></p>
